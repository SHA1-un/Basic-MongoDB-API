# Basic-MongoDB-API
Very basic MongoDB API with CRUD operations. Ready for deployment to Heroku or any other deployment environment. 

## Note
- In order to use your own MongoDb data model, it is necesary to change the `model.js` file to accmodate your schema. 
- Route enpoints can be changed as you deem fit. It's honestly personal preference and use case dependant.
- Originally this API was used for a VERY basic Flutter Quiz App. Keep that in mind.
